# Salary Calculator: 
    Write an Annual Salary Calculator based on Hours.
    This Program should calculate unadjusted and adjusted salary.
    The User will be prompted to input their weekly Salary, hours, and days. 
    The user will also be prompted to put vacations and holidays.
    The code takes the weekly hours * salary per hour * and the weeks per year,
     and to calculate the Unadjusted Annual Salary.
    The code will also calculate the days per year with subtraction of the holidays/vacations.
    Using the adjusted days per year times the hourly salary times the weekly hours, which are 
     divided by the days per week, the code calculates the Adjusted Annual Salary
    Then these Annual Salaries are displayed to the User.
